## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rst

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
mydata1<-read_xlsx("belongingdata.xlsx")
ds<-cor.test(mydata1$TotalBelonging,mydata1$AverageBelonging)
summary(ds)
```

## Including Table

You can also embed Tables, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(mydata1, width = "100", height = "auto")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
